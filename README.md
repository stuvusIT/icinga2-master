# icinga2-master

This role installs Icinga 2 and configures it for a generic master.
A new CA is initialized and a local certificate is signed using the CA.
A PostgreSQL database can be initialized (user and database) and the schema is automatically imported.
A couple of generic configuration files is created, but no checks, hosts, ....
[icinga2-config](https://github.com/stuvusIT/icinga2-config) is responsible for that.

However, a zone file for all hosts in the inventory is created.
Each host gets an Endpoint and a Zone consisting of only this endpoint.
The parent of this Zone is defined via the host variable `icinga2_parent_zone`.
This variable must point to an existing Ansible group.
All hosts in this group get assigned to a Zone by that name and won't be assigned to their own zones.
If a parent Zone has itself as its parent, it is assumed that this is the root Zone and it won't get a parent.

Additional, a global zone called `global-templates` is created.
